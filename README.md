# ZK Bootcamp

## Week 1

### Class 1
1. ZK proves that honest computation has been done.
2. "ZK gives out a similar vibe as ML... It is a magic solution that fixes everything with no limit to its application"

#### Group Theory
3. Group im math is basically something that encapsulates all the results of any operation in between any elements of a specific set of elements. (Closure)
4. (Identity Element) is like 0 for arithmetic addition and 1 for multiplication arithmetic. It is the element `e` for which `a * e = a`, where `*` is basically an custom operation inside the group.
5. (Inverse Element) is an element `b` in the Group for which `b*a = a*b = e`, where e is the identity element. This is like `-` for positive integers.
6. (Cyclic group) It is a finite group (group that has a finite set of elements in the group) where there is an elements whose there is a property that there is a generator element from where we can cicle all the group doing the operation defined and we would end up in the same place we've started. 
7. (Order of a Finite Field): A field with a finite number of elements can be counted and the number of its elements is called `order`.
8. Algebraic structure == group.
9. (Homorphism): basically is f(x.y) equals f(x).f(y), where `.` represents an operation.
10. Ellipctic curves satisfy the properties of a group.
11. VRF do not only produce randomness, but they also provide a proof so that the computation can be verified that the computation for randomness is, indeed, fair.
12. Polynommials are different when it comes comparing them for equality in a finite field over on real numbers.
