	I guess, there is always collision probability since we work in finite fields, but this probability is really small
11:14:31 From Noah Jelich To Everyone:
	Replying to "What's the thresho..."
	
	Take the logic and extend it. In the social sciences, a result may be considered "significant" if its confidence level is of the order of a two-sigma effect (95%), while in particle physics, there is a convention of a five-sigma effect (99.99994% confidence) being required to qualify as a discovery.

11:42:01 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	For anyone who has trouble understanding non-interactive proofs, I can share my intuition. For every ZK Circuit (A.K.A. “proof”), you will have two sets of cryptographic keys: the prover key, and the verifier key. The prover key is used to generate the ZK proof, the verifier key is used to verify it. The proof represents “an observation of execution”. The verifier key verifies if that execution was done strictly accordingly to what the ZK Circuit (A.K.A. “zero-knowledge program/proof”) has defined.

11:44:13 From Caio Barros To Everyone:
	Reacted to "For anyone who has t..." with 🙌
11:45:09 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	The key point, is that a ZK Proof represents an observation of execution of a program. When you generate a ZK proof, you execute a ZK Circuit/program, and the proof shows that “I have observed this computation, and here is the proof of what I observed”. The proof of the computation that was observed can then be verified by the verification key. The verification key checks if the observed execution corresponds to the claimed ZK Proof/Program.

	Proof includes a binding commitment of the inputs. In some cases, a random sample from the field is taken to generate intermediate values (gp = general parameters) and this are commited and used by the prover.
	
	Transparent setup is where setup is not needed and usees public randomness which the verifier has access to.

	@Robert | Extropy okay so yes, lambda is the reason for the trusted setup 👍

	Ahh, it’s a part of the trusted setup. Thank you!

	I think zkEVM is more about proving the current state of the system and doesnt require every node to keep the whole blockchain data to get the same state but rather the proof is enough
12:13:59 From Ugur Sen To Everyone:
	Bulletproofs doesnt require trusted setup causes it relies on IPA commitments unlike KZG

	Yep, I see it correctly - no worries!

	For anyone interested, I suggest reading the SNARKS paper.
12:14:25 From Carlo Parisi To Everyone:
	Was the ZKG ceremony of the proto dank sharing about this secret?
12:14:28 From Rafael Nicolau To Everyone:
	Is the KZG ceremony also an example of acquiring randomness for a trusted setup?
12:15:12 From Ugur Sen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Is the KZG ceremony ..."
	
	also jointly random yes I guess
12:15:29 From Rafael Nicolau To Everyone:
	Reacted to "also jointly random ..." with 👍
12:16:10 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	For anyone interested, the part that is being explained (very well) now is also explained in details in the SNARKS paper.
12:16:20 From Carlo Parisi To Everyone:
	Don’t you need the secret to create the proof?
12:16:23 From amir jabarivasal To Everyone:
	Can we do a ceremony?
12:16:39 From Robert | Extropy To Everyone:
	Replying to "in the table did the..."
	
	Bulletproofs are non-interactive that require no trusted setup.
12:16:49 From Seungmin Jeon To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Bulletproofs are non..." with 👍
12:16:55 From Rafael Nicolau To Everyone:
	So basically the randomness of everyone is hashed, and if someone "forgets" the randomness they submitted this lambda cannot be reproduced?

12:17:42 From Gerald Iakobinyi-Pich To Everyone:
	Will that parameter lambda be stored somewhere?
12:18:08 From Diego Gallegos To Everyone:
	Replying to "Will that parameter ..."
	
	I think it should be deleted after setup
12:18:21 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	Regarding public ceremonies, the question is always who are the participants in it. If the vast majority belongs to a particular (attacking) group, then the security can be compromised.
12:18:31 From Ugur Sen To Everyone:
	Replying to "Is the KZG ceremony ..."
	
	In particular, you contribute the inside secret without knowing the previous secret (: MPC

	I believe it’s about a single person being honest, not the majority.
12:19:57 From Dogus U To Everyone:
	is the waste stored somewhere for later use ? or is not needed after the ceremony

	@Max Sultakov yeah, I believe you are correct
12:21:09 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	Replying to "Don’t you need the s..."
	
	Indirectly
12:21:22 From Nikos Koumbakis | Jumaru.eth To Everyone:
	I was there, you can trust it 😁
12:21:25 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	Replying to "Don’t you need the s..."
	
	The lambda (secret parameter) that was used to create prover and verifier keys
12:21:45 From MaxMustermann2 To Everyone:
	Replying to "Don’t you need the s..."
	
	Only the Common Reference String is required. Lambda must be discarded afterwards.
12:21:47 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:
	Replying to "Don’t you need the s..."
	
	Prover and verifier keys are public and deterministic (please correct me if I’m mistaken on the deterministic part, but I doubt so)
12:21:49 From Carlo Parisi To Everyone:
	Replying to "Don’t you need the s..."
	
	So it is used to create the keys and then destroyed?

12:22:45 From Illya Gerasymchuk To Everyone:

	@Carlo Parisi yes
12:23:16 From Robert | Extropy To Everyone:
	Replying to "is the waste stored ..."
	
	toxic waste is deleted after the setup
